# circ_finder

**This Python package was bulit to identify potential circular RNAs in bulk RNA-seq data.**


The following commands were included in the package:

**Top level parser**: circRNA parsing and seed match

**seed_extract**: extracting seed sequences from miRNAs

**parse**: parsing back-splicing junctions

**reannotate**: reannotate circRNAs

**filter_junctions**: filtering junctions

**extract exonic sequences and seed matching**: seed matching for selected circRNAs

**find conserved junctions between species**: detecting conserved junctions between speicies
